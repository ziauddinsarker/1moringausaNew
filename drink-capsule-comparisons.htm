					  <p align="justify" class="toplinks">A Question From Grace Regarding Drinks Containing Moringa</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">First of all we were formerly selling and
						using Zxxx (full name deleted so as to not infringe on any trademarks!). Now we'd like to buy moringa in it's purest form. Do you know what the equivalent amount of Moringa
						would be in capsule form as compared to a can of Zxxx?</p>
					  <center>
						<p align="left" class="bodytext">Secondly, I will offer your product for people to buy moringa
						  in my small farm store&mdash;but I suggest/request that you
						  consider a more sophisticated label. The mod dancing couple will
						  mean nothing to the locals here. I will try to convince them
						  that the product is worth a try, but I don&rsquo;t think the
						  label helps sell it.</p>
						<p align="justify" class="bodytext">Blessings to you, and thank you for putting
						  moringa capsules on the market,</p>
						<p align="justify" class="bodytext">Grace<br />
						12/12/14</p>
						<p align="left" class="style16">One capsule has more pure powdered Moringa
						  leaf than one can of Zxxx. Zxxx is a proprietary formula which means the exact recipe for the drink,its contents, are a secret. It's pretty obvious though upon visual inspection that there isn't much pure powdered leaf, the most potent part of moringa, in the drink. People who buy moringa in the capsule form find it to be much more affordable, easier to
						  travel with, and more effective than Zxxx.</p>
						<p align="left" class="style16">The good thing about the capsule is that you
						  can easily self-dose because you will feel the difference on the
						  first or second day. The recommended dosage is between 1-4
						  capsules per day. Many people who ingest more than two Zxxx cans per day often experience diarrhea. Most people who buy moringa capsules take one before breakfast and one
						  before lunch, on an empty stomach. Those who are more sensitive
						  take only one per day. Those who are larger in size or less
						  sensitive will take more. </p>
						<p align="left" class="style16">Moringa is extremely non-toxic as it's
						  fed to infants in Africa and is all natural. We know of several
						  athletes and high profile artists who take as many as 12-16 prior
						  to a game or performance. They wouldn't think of working
						  without them.</p>
						<p align="left" class="style16">We've gotten lots of comments about the
						  unusual nature of the label, mostly good, a few bad. We're
						  listening to feedback but the run on labels is 10,000 so it's not
						  so easily changed. We appreciate your comments. We do have some
						  bottles that are unlabeled. As a dealer selling to people who want to buy moringa you are entitled to put
						  your own label on the product, after we view it for confirmation
						  to industry standards. If you are only doing it 12 at a time you
						  can create your own label on a computer and use self-adhesive
						  labels. That's how we started out, 8 years ago.</p>
						<p align="left" class="style16">We appreciate your business!</p>

					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks">An Unsigned Comment From a Zxxx Distributor </span></p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Someone told me about your website so I just had to check it out...  I noticed you used to be a Zxxx distributor but only stayed in the business for 3 months because you couldn’t enroll anyone... I can respect the fact that it didn’t work for you.. Network marketing isn’t for everyone. I have been a Zxxx distributor since April of 2010.. I have enrolled numerous people and have a large downline. I’m sorry it didn’t work for you.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"> As I read everything on your site, you stated that Zxxx uses a proprietary blend and that is true.. But if you would have asked Russ Bxxxxxi to tell you what is in each can of Zxxx or pack of smart mix, you would know that he will tell you. I have had several customers and doctors ask that very question and Russ always is quick to tell anyone the answer.. If you actually researched moringa, then you would know that each part of the plant, from the leaves to the roots, is loaded with nutrients and each part is beneficial to everyone, not just the leaves. Common sense tells me that if you use each part of the tree in making a product, then you will get the most benefits..  Every person is different when it comes to consuming anything.. The time it takes for each of us to see any difference with ourselves depends. I could tell a difference in 4 days, but have had many people see a difference in a matter of hours.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"> It does bother me that you have put down Zxxx like you have with your
						comments and in answering peoples questions. I’m not putting down what
						you have and I think you should respect the Zxxx distributors and not put down their products and business..Just because you couldn’t succeed in MLM, there is no need to knock it. When I enrolled I was told to succeed I needed to commit for 1 year. It took me 3 months to get my first 2 and in the next 6 months I enrolled countless others.  Most all of them are still doing the business and using the products.  Maybe if you would have given it more time and put a little more effort into learning the system and how networking works, then you would have been successful. Network marketing is work, it isn’t a hobby, but it is fun. I don’t have to punch a clock and I can do it wherever I go. I’ve been in other companies before, as well as the corporate world, and this system and this company if far better than any I have ever come across.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"> I will be entering my 2nd year  with Zxxx this spring and I will never quit. It is too simple to make a good income without a lot of effort and have the time freedom that I wanted for myself and my family. My 3 children are all in the business and have been very successful. None of them work other jobs and Zxxx provides very well for them. They wouldn’t be making anywhere near what they do if they worked in the corporate world. They are college graduates with very good degrees and this is the path they have chosen to follow and it has been a blessing for each of them. They chose not to give up or be bothered by the “no’s” they get.. They know that a “yes” is just around the corner. </p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">I would assume that since you have opened your own moringa business, that it takes quite a bit of your time to market and package orders.  And that since you have your own factory that you have a sizable overhead. I know you market online and that is done from home, but I do know business and know that it can be expensive. With Zxxx they take care of all that for me and I can sleep all day, vacation when I want (been on 7 this year) enjoy family time, shop, dine, visit friends, or whatever I want and never have to worry about checking to see if I have orders and make the time to mail them. I don’t have to make sure that I have enough of a supply of moringa to meet the demand, make sure quality control practices are in order and make sure I’m not getting an inferior product. I’m free as I can be and I love it. Can you say the same?????</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Received on <span class="bodytext">12-21-2011</span></p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="style16">(We never respond to unsigned letters in any of our businesses but you sounded genuine, sincere, and were respectful with your comments, so we decided to write back.)</span></p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">We’re doing all right. You say to-may-to, we say to-mah-to. Different strokes for different folks. We have a very good friend who has spent a lifetime in MLM and has done quite well for himself, as it appears you have, with several different nutritional companies. More power to ya.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">We don’t knock the Zxxx product on our website, only MLM. There is a commission structure in Zxxx that makes the product extremely expensive. Many people are willing to pay that, some would rather not. No double blind tests by an independent researcher have been run to see if one product is better than the other, and that will probably never be done. The only advantage we have over you is that we’ve experienced both products and you haven’t.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> If Russ “is quick to tell” people the ingredients of his proprietary blend, maybe you could pass that along to us, especially the total amount of moringa in mgs per can and/or smartmix. Why isn’t he equally eagerly “quick to tell” the proprietary blend on his website?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> When we first started our capsule business Zxxx went legal on us to protect their trademark. This we understand and respect. But they were so heavy handed as to be absurd. They were the big guy and we were the mouse that roared. They made their point, and we responded appropriately, but they pressed it to the very ends. Why such a large company would spend all that time and money on us at the highest levels was really quite flattering. However, it only served to inspire us further to find ways into their niche, which we’ve done.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> It really was quite silly because the business we get are from people who don’t want MLM and/or who can’t afford the Zxxx prices, business Zxxx would never have gotten anyway. Even today, the business they lose because of us is so minuscule as to be barely calculate-able. Yet we know we’re getting under their skin and that brings us great satisfaction. Bottom line: they do what they do, we do what we do.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> We wish you all the best with your MLM business. You have a good product and you are helping the world stay healthy, as we are. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</p>
