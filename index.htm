                    <p class="bodytext"><strong>Moringa Oleifera</strong> capsules sold by Moringa USA are 100% pure moringa from the Moringa Tree. There are no fillers or by products in our capsules. Moringa Oleifera capsules have been known throughout history for increasing energy, stamina, endurance and mental clarity when taken as a regular part of daily diet. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">There is no doubt that the Moringa Oleifera tree yields leaf that is the source of incredible health benefits. It's the ultimate, natural, organic, energy and endurance health supplement. There is plenty of information on this web site and others (click on &quot;Resources &amp; Videos&quot; on the page bottom menu bar) that describe these benefits. India's ancient tradition of ayurveda medicine sites 300 diseases that are treated with the powdered leaf of the tree. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Our business model includes selling the finest powdered moringa leaf available on the market. The potency of our farm's output is excellent and we ensure that the product comes fresh to you by converting the container from bottles to pouches. In addition we want to earn your trust. We've seen moringa capsules for sale for as little at $8 per bottle. We wouldn't ingest that ever! Some vendors sell moringa that's been manually encapsulated. We hope they wore gloves! Moringa is not expensive so to pay a little more for the finest available is a no-brainer. That's our Moringa Zinga!</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">You may have seen the following, over enthusiastic, marketing claims made by Multi Level Marketing companies and other vendors. It's totally inaccurate and is making the rounds all over the internet.</p>
                    <p class="style23">Gram for gram, the leaf contains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="style23"> 7 times the vitamin C in oranges</li>
                        <li class="style23"> 4 times the calcium in milk</li>
                        <li class="style23"> 4 times the vitamin A in carrots</li>
                        <li class="style23"> 2 times the protein in milk</li>
                        <li class="style23"> 3 times the potassium in bananas</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bodytext">To gain your trust we'll tell you the real truth. Gram for gram, the leaf contains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="bodytext"> 1.1 times the vitamin C in oranges</li>
                        <li class="bodytext"> 1.5 times the calcium in milk</li>
                        <li class="bodytext"> 0 times the vitamin A in carrots</li>
                        <li class="bodytext"> 2.8 times the protein in milk</li>
                        <li class="bodytext"> 0 times the potassium in bananas</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bodytext">However, moringa leaf contains 16 vitamins, 10 minerals, 18 amino acids, 4 flavonoids, and 0 lipids. For a complete listing compiled not by high pressure salesmen but by the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, go to our <a href="nutritionalvalues.htm">Nutritional Values</a> page.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Our pure, powdered, vegetarian capsules are organic and safe. There are no known side effects. It is gentle enough to be given to babies in Africa to overcome malnourishment. Professional athletes ingest the capsules in mega doses to improve their performance mentally and physically. Moringa is a nutrition rich natural food source that can enhance the health of individuals deficient in the vitamins, protein, and minerals supplied in the leaves. <strong>Moringa Tree</strong> products are great for people of all ages, especially seniors who are losing their alertness.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Although there have been references to the <em>Moringa Oleifera Tree</em> that go back a couple thousand years, and the World Health Organization has been studying and using the powdered leaf for the last forty years as a low cost health enhancer in the poorest countries around the world, there is a reason why it's still relatively unknown. The sale of all forms of vitamins, minerals, and health supplements is a big business. If you were a company selling hundreds of nutritional products, why would you sell one product that could potentially wipe out the sale of all your other products? This is true for the pharmaceutical industry as well. These big business interests, with huge marketing budgets, would rather the general public remain ignorant about the amazing capsules from the moringa tree.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We are not a multi-level marketing company like the one that sells a drink claiming to have the leaf as an ingredient along with many artificial additives. Instead, we bring you 100% pure powdered leaf capsules and we offer it for a reasonable price. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We don't scrimp on quality either. We scoured the world to find the best organic moringa tree farmers on the planet. The leaves must be grown, harvested, and dried properly. We spend lots of money doing potency testing on various samples from suppliers around the world, including the best in America. We know our capsules can't be beat. There are other vendors selling products at lower prices but not one can match our quality. We guarantee it. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We are seeking to improve the health of people around the world. And, that's why we sell capsules in its pure, powdered form. You should begin your research at our &quot;Moringa Zinga Benefits&quot; page by clicking on the link at the tabs bar above. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We appreciate your business!</p>

                    <p class="bodytext">Moringa USA stands by the following statement: <strong><em>No moringa capsules stored in a bottle can ever be as potent as those stored in a pouch.</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Most people don't know that Moringa loses its potency very quickly due to exposure to air and light. The most potent Moringa grown loses 40% of its potency within two weeks of harvesting if not air and light protected and another 40% within six months. Moringa capsules that are sold in bottles aren't worth ingesting after six months of harvesting, no matter how potent the original source.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Our Moringa capsules are one of the few in the industry to be packaged within 24 hours of harvesting in a 100% oxygen free and light blocking pouch that you can reseal after opening. </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">You can SMELL THE DIFFERENCE! You can SEE THE DIFFERENCE in the clean, bright green, color of the pure powdered leaf ensuring that you have the highest quality, freshest, and most potent Moringa capsules on the market today.</p>

                    <p><span class="bodytext">4/17/15 - Here’s another great reason why Moringa  is considered the “miracle tree.”  By adding Moringa Oleifera to your diet, you benefit your body’s overall health as well as the health and beauty of your hair.  Moringa Oleifera is full of nutrients, such as vitamins A, B, and E, potassium, zinc, and calcium that help your hair to be strong and shiny while protecting it against breakage and hair loss. <a href="http://www.moringausa.com/blog/beautiful-hair-with-moringa-oleifera/" class="bodytext">read more</a></span></p>
                    <p><span class="bodytext">4/6/15 - More uses continue to be discovered for the “miracle tree”, Moringa Oleifera.  A recent study, led by Professor Adrian Rennie which was published in the Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, suggests that the crushed seeds of the Moringa Oleifera tree can be manipulated to separate different materials in the mining process.  Now mining can be added to the many nutritional, water purification, and health benefits that this remarkable tree provides. <a href="http://www.moringausa.com/blog/moringa-oleifera-seeds-used-in-mining/" class="bodytext">read more</a></span></p>
                    <p><span class="bodytext">3/26/15 - A recent study concluded that the methanolic extracts from Moringa Oleifera were effective in reducing arthritis pain in  rats.  It has some of the most potent natural anti-inflammatory compounds that have been discovered, which makes it very effective at inhibiting enzymes that cause joint pain.  With each new study, science continues to reveal more health benefits of Moringa. <a href="http://www.moringausa.com/blog/moringa-oleifera-for-joint-pain/" class="bodytext">read more</a></span></p>
                    <p><span class="bodytext">3/20/15 - The world is learning just how versatile the Moringa Oleifera tree can be.

One of the best ways to get these high concentrations of antioxidants is to brew it as a tea.  It's great for your health and does not contain caffeine like some teas, such as green tea, that can be harmful to your health.  <a href="http://www.moringausa.com/blog/moringa-tea-for-good-health/" class="bodytext">read more</a></span></p>
