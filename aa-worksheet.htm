					  <p class="style18">What other prods do you sell (I could not find them on the MoringaUSA web site)?        </p>
					  <p class="style16">Aloe Vera http://www.1st-aloe-vera.com/ and Homeopathic HGH oral spray http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/        </p>
					  <p class="style18">Are there any noticeable bodily changes/evidence one might experience indicating the Moringa Leaf
						is having positive health effects?        </p>
					  <p class="style16">Everyone responds to the product differently so it's hard to know how it will affect you but most people have a big increase in energy, meaning that usually when you have a "low" period you just keep going and going. Other effects most people get are a more active mind, no more colds, and minimized flu episodes.        </p>
					  <p class="style18">Why does label only indicate Moringa good for Energy/Endurance when all of what I have read indicates many significant Health benefits from Moringa?  Indicating only 'Energy/Endurance' on label seems to greatly minimize product.        </p>
					  <p class="style16">There's only just so much you can put on a label!        </p>
					  <p class="style18">Does Moringa offer positive benefit for digestion/regularity?   If so, please provide some detail if possible.        </p>
					  <p class="style16">As moringa leaf is the only plant on the planet that goes to wherever you are nutritionally deficient it will help with digestion/regularity if those ailments are due to some nutritional deficiency.        </p>
					  <p class="style18">Does Moringa offer cardio benefit(s)?  If so, please provide some detail if possible.        </p>
					  <p class="style16">Same answer as above.        </p>
					  <p class="style18">Does Moringa contain Chlorophyll?  Is Moringa Leaf then good as a body deodorizer?        </p>
					  <p class="style16">Moringa does contain chlorophyll. We haven't heard back from anyone saying that it has worked for them as a body deodorizer.</p>
					  <p class="style18"> Is the encapsulated Moringa Zinga as absorbable and bio available as liquid Moringa?        </p>
					  <p class="style16">Most teas contain much less of the pure powdered leaf than the capsules. The capsules are very absorbable. I've not seen any studies comparing the absorbability of capsules versus teas or other pure powdered liquid potions.        </p>
					  <p class="style16">We looked up your source of Moringa Zinga, Natural Healing, and they do, indeed, buy wholesale from us and then resell it. Their pricing matches ours.
						
						We appreciate your business!</p>
					  <p class="bodytext">Are the positive health benefits of Moringa an immediate effect after start

					  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" />
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">I have been looking for a moringa product and yours looks good: organic, the way it is processed. I have a couple of questions about moringa in general and about yours in particular.<br />
						General:<br />
						I have read that the most effective form of the moringa is liquid with no additives. Yet many sell it in capsules. Can you clarify for me which way is better to take it in order to get the best absorption and utilization of the nutrients in it -- liquid (tea) or powder?<br />
						<br />
						If liquid is better, would making a tea out of a capsule work?<br />
						Is there any need to continue using a multi-vitamin if using moringa?<br />
						I have some bone loss (female age 56) and am taking 1200mg of calcium a day. I read that moringa has 440mg of calcium on one website and 2000mg on another website in 100 gram of edible moringa. I think 100 grams is  more than one would generally take in a day. Is that correct?<br />
						<br />
						Should I start slowly with this and build up as I have chronic illness?<br />
						Specific to your company:<br />
						Where (what country) are your trees grown?<br />
						Are the moringa leaves and the finished product tested for bacteria, toxins, chemicals, etc.?<br />
						<br />
						I am wondering how that affects how much calcium supplement I should take. How much calcium would one consume in one of your capsules of moringa?<br />
						<br />
						Thank you for your help, I appreciate it a lot as I am trying to decide where to buy moringa.<br />

					  <p align="left" class="style16"> Capsules are the most potent form to ingest Moringa.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">If liquid is better, would making a tea out of a capsule work?        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">People in other cultures like the tea and use moringa as a spice in food. </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">Is there any need to continue using a multi-vitamin if using moringa?        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">No.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">I have some bone loss (female age 56) and am taking 1200mg of calcium a day.

					  <p align="left" class="style16">Yes.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">Should I start slowly with this and build up as I have chronic illness?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> We recommend 1-4 per day. Most people take 1 or 2 per day. We know some baseball players who take 12 before a game. The World Health Organization feeds 4 grams to malnourished infants per day (that's 8 capsules) and lactating mothers 8 grams per day (16 capsules). It's totally non-toxic. It's very easy to self dose as you will feel it in your system. Start with 1 for a couple days, then increase to 2 for a couple days, and keep upping the dose until you feel like you want to feel. My girlfriend who is petite takes more than me because she likes to be more of an energizer bunny than I do.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">Where (what country) are your trees grown?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> India, 200 year old organic farm.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">Are the moringa leaves and the finished product tested for bacteria, toxins, chemicals, etc.?        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">Tested 3 times. Once by customs before they allow it in, once by us, and once by the encapsulator. The encapsulator does the most rigorous test because they don't want anything nasty running through their machines.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">I am wondering how that affects how much calcium supplement I should take. How much calcium would one consume in one of your capsules of moringa?        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">If you have a low calcium situation you should probably keep taking the calcium tablets. Moringa will go to wherever you are nutritionally deficient so most people eventually stop taking most of their other supplements (which is why vitamin shops don't carry moringa...it negatively effects their business).        </p>

					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Received on 12-20-2011</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Someone told me about your website so I just had to check it out...  I noticed you used to be a Zxxx distributor but only stayed in the business for 3 months because you couldn’t enroll anyone... I can respect the fact that it didn’t work for you.. Network marketing isn’t for everyone. I have been a Zxxx distributor since April of 2010.. I have enrolled numerous people and have a large downline. I’m sorry it didn’t work for you.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">        As I read everything on your site, you stated that Zxxx uses a proprietary blend and that is true.. But if you would have asked Russ Bxxxxxi to tell you what is in each can of Zxxx or pack of smart mix, you would know that he will tell you. I have had several customers and doctors ask that very question and Russ always is quick to tell anyone the answer.. If you actually researched moringa, then you would know that each part of the plant, from the leaves to the roots, is loaded with nutrients and each part is beneficial to everyone, not just the leaves. Common sense tells me that if you use each part of the tree in making a product, then you will get the most benefits..  Every person is different when it comes to consuming anything.. The time it takes for each of us to see any difference with ourselves depends. I could tell a difference in 4 days, but have had many people see a difference in a matter of hours.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">        It does bother me that you have put down Zxxx like you have with your
						comments and in answering peoples questions. I’m not putting down what
						you have and I think you should respect the Zxxx distributors and not put down their products and business..Just because you couldn’t succeed in MLM, there is no need to knock it. When I enrolled I was told to succeed I needed to commit for 1 year. It took me 3 months to get my first 2 and in the next 6 months I enrolled countless others.  Most all of them are still doing the business and using the products.  Maybe if you would have given it more time and put a little more effort into learning the system and how networking works, then you would have been successful. Network marketing is work, it isn’t a hobby, but it is fun. I don’t have to punch a clock and I can do it wherever I go. I’ve been in other companies before, as well as the corporate world, and this system and this company if far better than any I have ever come across.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">        I will be entering my 2nd year  with Zxxx this spring and I will never quit. It is too simple to make a good income without a lot of effort and have the time freedom that I wanted for myself and my family. My 3 children are all in the business and have been very successful. None of them work other jobs and Zxxx provides very well for them. They wouldn’t be making anywhere near what they do if they worked in the corporate world. They are college graduates with very good degrees and this is the path they have chosen to follow and it has been a blessing for each of them. They chose not to give up or be bothered by the “no’s” they get.. They know that a “yes” is just around the corner.  </p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">I would assume that since you have opened your own moringa business, that it takes quite a bit of your time to market and package orders.  And that since you have your own factory that you have a sizable overhead. I know you market online and that is done from home, but I do know business and know that it can be expensive. With Zxxx they take care of all that for me and I can sleep all day, vacation when I want ( been on 7 this year) enjoy family time, shop, dine, visit friends, or whatever I want and never have to worry about checking to see if I have orders and make the time to mail them. I don’t have to make sure that I have enough of a supply of moringa to meet the demand, make sure quality control practices are in order and make sure I’m not getting an inferior product. I’m free as I can be and I love it. Can you say the same?????</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Unsigned</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"><span class="bodytext">Sent on 12-21-2011</span></p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">(We never respond to unsigned letters in any of our businesses but you sounded genuine, sincere, and were respectful with your comments, so we decided to write back.)</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">        We’re doing all right. You say to-may-to, we say to-mah-to. Different strokes for different folks. We have a very good friend who has spent a lifetime in MLM and has done quite well for himself, as it appears you have, with several different nutritional companies. More power to ya.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">We don’t knock the Zxxx product on our website, only MLM. There is a commission structure in Zxxx that makes the product extremely expensive. Many people are willing to pay that, some would rather not. No double blind tests by an independent researcher have been run to see if one product is better than the other, and that will probably never be done. The only advantage we have over you is that we’ve experienced both products and you haven’t.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> If Russ “is quick to tell” people the ingredients of his proprietary blend, maybe you could pass that along to us, especially the total amount of moringa in mgs per can and/or smartmix. Why isn’t he equally eagerly “quick to tell” the proprietary blend on his website?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16">        When we first started our capsule business Zxxx went legal on us to protect their trademark. This we understand and respect. But they were so heavy handed as to be absurd. They were the big guy and we were the mouse that roared. They made their point, and we responded appropriately, but they pressed it to the very ends. Why such a large company would spend all that time and money on us at the highest levels was really quite flattering. However, it only served to inspire us further to find ways into their niche, which we’ve done. It really was quite silly because the business we get are from people who don’t want MLM and/or who can’t afford the Zxxx prices, business Zxxx would never have gotten anyway. Even today, the business they lose because of us is so minuscule as to be barely calculate-able. Yet we know we’re getting under their skin and that brings us great satisfaction. Bottom line: they do what they do, we do what we do.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style16"> We wish you all the best with your MLM business. You have a good product and you are helping the world stay healthy, as we are. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</p>

					  <p class="bodytext">Double blind studies are only done with drugs. Moringa isn't a drug. It's a plant. </p>
					  <p class="bodytext"> I did find it quite funny that you used the word zinga to call your product. That would seem to be a slur to Zxxx.</p>
					  <p class="bodytext"> As for Zxxx being expensive, $3.00 a day isn't expensive. Most people spend that daily at convenience stores on cokes and other junk. It just seems expensive when you spend it once a month. Lol</p>
					  <p class="bodytext">I wish you well in your business and hope you have a Merry Christmas!!!</p>

					  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" />
					  <p class="bodytext">I have recently purchased my first bottle of Moringa Zinga but have not begun taking it as I had some questions related to other medications I am currently taking.  I do not want to diminish the effects of the meds I am on, nor do I want to diminsh the effectiveness of the Moringa Zinga if it does not interact well with my current medications.<br />
						  <br />
						  I have digestive and reflux issues and am taking 40 mg. of Omeprazole - 2x daily and I also take Amitiza - 2x daily, along with another medication, which is taken on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis for bladder spasms, but whose name and dosage I do not have with me. <br />
						  <br />
				Additionally, each day I take a probiotic capsule and 1,200 mg. of fish oil, vitamin B complex, calcium capsule, cranberry capsule and a vitamin D capsule.  This group of meds is taken in the morning.<br />
				<br />
				My question is, would any of the above mentioned meds interact badly with the Moringa Zinga and lessen it's effects or would the Moringa Zinga interfere with any of the above mentioned med?  I would like to know the best way to incorporate the Moringa Zinga into my current regime in order to get the best results from it.  I am anxious to start taking it and seeing some results!<br />
				<br />
				Thank you,<br />
				<br />

					  <p class="bodytext">Moringa is more like a food rather than a nutritional supplement. So it's fine to take with all your other supplements. After a month or so you will probably give up a lot of the other supplements you are taking. Take Moringa on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning. If you want to take a second dose take it 15-20 minutes before lunch.</p>
					  <p class="bodytext">We are not doctors and know nothing about your other meds. If you have concerns, check with your doctor.</p>
					  <p class="bodytext">We appreciate your business!</p>
					  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" />
					  <p><span class="bodytext">I am going to place an order, and just wanted to check something with you. I notice that your Moringa capsules are more expensive than
				competitors. Can you let me know why, just so I am prepared when I start to sell
				Many thanks
				Duncan</span><br />
					  </p>
					  <p class="bodytext">Moringa is a very hearty plant and can be grown anywhere in hot climates. As a result there are a lot of &quot;backyard&quot; farms. This we discovered when we started our business and checked out many different sources all over the world. We quickly realized that we would never be able to compete with the discounters, many of whom encapsulate with their bare fingers and sell capsules in bags! What they sell I wouldn't put in my body. </p>
					  <p class="bodytext">Additionally we discovered that there was a wide variety of potencies. So the main element of our business plan is that there might be equal products to ours but there would never be a more potent, clean, or effective product than ours. </p>
					  <p class="bodytext">We tested many samples at considerable expense ($200 per sample). We eventually picked a 200 year old organic farm. After 200 years they know exactly what seeds to use, how to ferilize, when to harvest, how to dry, how to ship, and each shipment is equally consistent. I'm confident that not only are we the best, but we set the industry standard. </p>
					  <p class="bodytext">I hope this helps. Good Luck with your sales. We've never sold a nutritional product that gets more resales than Moringa!</p>

						I'm interested in your product and have a few questions. </p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">1)  Is there any contraindication to taking this product if a person has Lupus (my sister) or Multiple Sclerosis (myself)? </p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">2)  Have you had clients with either of these diseases who have taken the product and found any change in health, either positive or negative, specifically related to either disease?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">3)  I read your statement regarding Fibromyalgia, which I also have, and that customers have said the fog disappears.  Fog is not my big problem with Fibro.  My problem is pain.  Does it seem to help <br />
						these people who have responded with their Fibro pain?  That would be great news.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">4)  Are there any side effects to taking this product?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">5)  If I purchase the &quot;buy 2 get 1 free&quot; arrangement but find no positive effects after a couple of months, could I return the two unused bottles and get money back for one for which I paid<br />
						(I hope this made sense)?</p>

					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">3)  I read your statement regarding Fibromyalgia, which I also have, and that customers have said the fog disappears.  Fog is not my big problem with Fibro.  My problem is pain.  Does it seem to help <br />
						      these people who have responded with their Fibro pain?  That would be great news.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Many people take it for joint pain associated with arthritis. We don't know about pain associated with Fibromyalgia. Moringa will help anything that is caused by a nutritional deficiency.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">4)  Are there any side effects to taking this product?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">No.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">5)  If I purchase the &quot;buy 2 get 1 free&quot; arrangement but find no positive effects after a couple of months, could I return the two unused bottles and get money back for one for which I paid</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Yes.</p>

					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">I have attached a sheet of the ingredients in Zija in one dose (which would be the same amount as one capsule<br />
						of Zinga).  Please advise if the ingredients in one capsule of Zinga would truly equal those in one dose of Zija.<br />
						<br />
						I would also greatly appreciate it if you could answer some other questions:<br />
						-My husband is a dialysis patient -- is Zinga save for dialysis patients?<br />
						-He has severe anemia and tiredness -- what dose (2 or 4 capsules daily) who you recommend for him?<br />
						-I read that Moringa (Zinga) has an appetite suppresant and have heard that people lose weight on it.<br />
				He is very thin and needs an appetite enhancer --not suppresant.  Is it safe for him from that standpoint?<br />
				-I also noticed that there are high amounts of potassium, calcium and phosphorus and dialysis patients<br />
				are warned to be careful about their intake of these minerals. Is Moringa (Zinga) also safe for him from that standpoint?<br />
				<br />
				I greatly appreciate your time and help and look forward to hearing from you soon.<br />

					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Zija is a processed drink with all kinds of additives. It's a &quot;proprietary&quot; recipe so they won't tell you exactly what's in it except that it does contain some moringa. Our capsules are unprocessed, pure, powdered moringa leaf with no fillers in an all vegetarian capsule. It's impossible to compare the two except with anecdotal reports from users who claim that 1 capsule equals 1 can in terms of results (energy, mental clarity, etc., etc). It's like trying to compare Orange Soda with freeze squeezed Orange Juice.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18">-My husband is a dialysis patient -- is Zinga save for dialysis patients?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Moringa is a food, not a supplement. It should be safe for dialysis but you should consult with your doctor.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"> <span class="style17">-He has severe anemia and tiredness -- what dose (2 or 4 capsules daily) who you recommend for him?</span><br />
					  </p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Moringa is totally non-toxic. The World Health Organization (United Nations) feeds 4 grams (8 capsules) to malnourished infants and 8 grams (16 capsules) to undernourished lactating mothers in Africa. We recommend 1-4 capsules per day. Most people take 1 or 2. It's easy to self dose as you will feel it within a day or two. Athletes and those with Fibromyalgia take more. Start with 1 for a few days and increase it from there until you are at a dose that you like.<br />

					  <p align="left" class="style18"> -I read that Moringa (Zinga) has an appetite suppresant and have heard that people lose weight on it. He is very thin and needs an appetite enhancer --not suppresant.  Is it safe for him from that standpoint?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">It's an appetite suppressant to the extent that people become so active that they constantly forget to eat lunch. It's easy and normal to eat food when it's placed before you. Your appetite remains the same. Those people looking to lose weight find that they have substantially fewer hunger pains during the day because the moringa is nourishing them. They use it to eat less and lose weight. </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style18"> -I also noticed that there are high amounts of potassium, calcium and phosphorus and dialysis patients are warned to be careful about their intake of these minerals. Is Moringa (Zinga) also safe for him from that standpoint?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">The unique part about moringa is that it goes to wherever you are nutritionally deficient. No other food in the world does that. It's unlikely that a mineral increase would occur but you should consult with your doctor.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">We do no personal diagnostics here as we are not professionals in the medical field. We can only speak to what we know about moringa. We suggest you try the product for yourself to see how benign it is and how it affects you. Then you might, after consulting with physicians, have your husband give it a try. If there is no downside risk, the upside potential is enormous.</p>
