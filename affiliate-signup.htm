						<p class="bodytext">Dear Moringa Zinga,</p>
						<p class="bodytext">I will first start out by saying that I am an independent distributor of Zxxx.  And I have researched the Moringa tree and cannot find anything that is bad regarding this plant.  My issue obviously is the price of Zxxx.  I have read most everything on your website and understand that one one time you were somehow although still not sure in what capacity you were connect to Zxxx. <br />
							  <br />
						  My one question is as far as the quality control that your company has regarding the product.  I know that Zxxx has informed us that they own like 98% of the Moringa in the world.  I just would like to know a little more about where your products are produced and what standards you use. <br />
							  <br />
						  I have a lot of faith in the person who formulated this product and I really don't feel like you would argue with that.  You have not once on your site stated that this (Zxxx) is a bad product or that there is anything other than the cost due to the MLM aspect of it.  I am interested in Moringa and only joined to get the product.  Obviously, you must try to &quot;sell&quot; the product in order to afford it.  I have no interest in doing anything ill towards you or Zxxx, I just want to get a 100% natural, pure product that will help me and my family.  I have several family members that have health issues and would not want to jeopardize their health with anything that is not pure or contains anything artificial. <br />
							  <br />
						  One other question that I had, I see that your mailing address is in Florida, but you have a California phone number.  Just saying, it looks odd.<br />
							  <br />
						  Thank you for your time.<br />
							  <br />

						<p class="style17">We'd love to see Zxxx substantiate the claim that they own 98% of all the Moringa in the world.</p>
						<p class="style17">We never say anything bad about Zxxx. We don't have to. They are who they are and we are who we are.</p>
						<p class="style17">When we started our business we knew that there would always be someone who might undersell us. But our business model was that no one should ever have a more potent product than us. So we searched the globe, India to Africa to America, to find the finest farm in the world. We sampled the potencies of Moringa from various farms at quite an expense, almost $1500 per test. We settled on a farm in India that's been growing Moringa for over two hundred years. It's an organic farm highly skilled in sowing, harvesting, drying, and shipping the powdered leaf properly. When it arrives in this country we do various tests for mold and other contaminants. We've never had a bad shipment. We'd like to purchase our Moringa from USA farms but the potency is probably 10-20 years away from equaling what we import now. The powdered leaf is then encapsulated and bottled in California where we began the business. Since then we've moved to Boca Raton but kept our original phone number.</p>
						<p class="style17">We appreciate your business!</p>
						<p class="style17">MoringaUSA.com</p>
						<p class="bodytext">That's exactly what I wanted to know from you as far as where and how you got your Moringa.  I have read several things on the internet and as you have said, India has the most potent and &quot;healthy&quot; for lack of better words of the tree.  America has striped and abused it's soil so much I totally agree with you on the farms from there.  Even if we grew it here, our soil quality is so poor, Moringa would never be the tree God intended it to be. <br />
							<br />
						  Zxxx has said that they own some farms in Africa but will probably be letting them go due to the politics of that region.  They never know who is going to hijack the trucks, the government or the pirates.  They also have plantations in India. <br />
					  <br />
						  Like I said, Moringa is obviously exactly what you and the makers of Zxxx have said, the Miracle Tree.  I just wanted to know that the people who are marketing it at a much lower price had quality control. <br />
					  <br />
						  One more thing.  I know that you said that you check the powdered leave for mold and contaminates, is it also checked to verify that the shippers have added nothing to the product?  You may have that assurance due to the fact that you have visited the farm and that is fine, just a question.<br />
					  <br />
						  My mother is all about health and natural products so she is the one who actually found your company in researching Zxxx and moringa.  The best option is that we try it and determine which works best for us.  Thank you for your time.<br />
